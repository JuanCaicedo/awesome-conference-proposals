# Format

Pull requests should be to a github repo which serves as an index of all of a
speaker's submissions. All the proposals should be listed in the readme file.

# Eligibility

The speaker must be accepted to at least one major conference. This is to ensure
that newer speakers who come to the repo looking for guidance will easily find
examples of successful proposals.

Any pull request that is not accepted based on the above reason will always be
open to reconsideration in the future. Because of this, we encourage all
speakers to keep us update on their progress, and we hope to include their work
in the future.
