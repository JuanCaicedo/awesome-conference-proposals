# awesome-conference-proposals

The goal of this repo is to showcase conference proposals from successful
speakers. In doing so, we want to make conference submissions more accessible
and less intimidating for aspiring speakers of all levels.

## A note on diversity

Often in the tech industry, we showcase the same type of people over and over.
This increases the likelihood that we also showcase the same ideas and fail to
include other viewpoints.

A great way to increase diversity of thought is to increase the diversity of
experience. Because of that, this project is geared towards showcasing
successful speakers of all gender identities and cultural backgrounds.

It's possible that we'll hold off on adding certain speakers to this list as we
attempt to encourage submissions from other speakers, to maintain a diverse
collection group.
